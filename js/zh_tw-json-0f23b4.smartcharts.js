The Alligator is as much a metaphor as it is an indicator. It consists of three lines, overlaid on a pricing chart, that represent the jaw, the teeth and the lips of the beast, and was created to help the trader confirm the presence of a trend and its direction. The Alligator indicator can also help traders designate impulse and corrective wave formations, but the tool works best when combined with a momentum indicator.":"比爾·威廉姆斯（Bill Williams）於1995年推出了鱷魚指標。鱷魚指標既是隱喻，也是指標。它由覆蓋在價格圖表上的三行線組成，分別代表鱷魚的下巴、牙齒和嘴唇。此指標的目的是為了幫助交易者確認趨勢的存在及其走向。鱷魚指標還可以幫助交易者指定脈沖和修正波的形成，但該工具與動量指標結合使用時效果最佳。","Bollinger Bands can be used to measure the highness or lowness of the price relative to previous trades.":"布林通道可用於測量與之前交易相對的價格變化高低點。","Box Size":"箱尺寸","Cancel":"取消","Candle":"蠟燭線","Channel [num]":"通道 [num]","Chart data is not available for this symbol.":"此符號不可用於圖表資料。","Chart types":"圖表類型","Charts":"圖表","Clear all":"全部清除","CLOSED":"已關閉","Color":"顏色","Continuous":"連續線","Continuous [num]":"連續 [num]","CSV":"CSV","Dark":"深色","day":"天","days":"天","Developed by Larry Williams, Williams %R is a momentum indicator that is the inverse of the Fast Stochastic Oscillator.

There are two separate indicators: Aroon-Up and Aroon-Down. A 25-day Aroon-Up measures the number of days since a 25-day high.

Welles Wilder 於1978年開發的一種顯示金融工具各項價格走勢強弱的指標。ADX 幅度介於0和100之間。一般來說，ADX低於20表示低弱走勢，數值高於40表示強大走勢。","The Awesome Oscillator is an indicator used to measure market momentum. AO calculates the difference of a 34 Period and 5 Period Simple Moving Averages. The Simple Moving Averages that are used are not calculated using closing price but rather each bar\'s midpoints. AO is generally used to affirm trends or to anticipate possible reversals.":"動量震盪指標是用於衡量市場動量的指標。AO 計算34個週期和5個週期的簡單移動平均的差。使用的簡單移動平均不是使用收盤價計算的，而是每個柱的中點價格。AO通常被用來確認趨勢或預期可能的逆轉。","The Commodity Channel Index (CCI) is a versatile indicator that can be used to identify a new trend or warn of extreme conditions.":"順勢指標 (CCI) 是個通用指標，可用於辨識新趨勢或預先對惡劣環境提出警告。","The Detrended Price Oscillator (DPO) helps to identify price cycles without the influence of short- and long-term trends. The DPO compares a simple moving average to a historical pricenear the middle of a specified period. It also shows the peaks and drops over that particular period, making it easier to predict buy points.":"去趨勢價格振盪指標（DPO）幫助確定價格週期，不受短期和長期趨勢影響。DPO 將簡單移動平均線與指定時期中間附近的歷史價格相比較。它還顯示了特定時期內的高峰和低谷，從而更容易預測購買點。","The Donchian Channel is an indicator used in market trading developed by Richard Donchian. It is formed by taking the highest high and the lowest low of the last n periods. The area between the high and the low is the channel for the period chosen.":"唐奇安通道是裡查德·唐奇安開發、用於市場交易的指標。以最近n週期內的最高價與最低價形成。高低價位中間區域是所選週期的通道。","The Gator Oscillator helps to detect trend changes in the market price. Based on the Alligator indicator, the Gator plots 2 histograms on either side of the zero line. The sleeping phase (absence of a trend) is when the bars on both sides are red. The awakening phase (formation of a trend) is when there are red and green bars on both sides. When there are green bars on both sides, it indicates the eating phase (trend strengthening). A solitary red bar appearing after the eating phase indicates the beginning of the sated phase (trend approaching its end).":"鱷魚振盪指標幫助檢測市場價格的趨勢變化。鱷魚根據短吻鱷指標在零線的任一側繪製2個直方圖。當兩側的條形為紅色時為睡眠階段（不存在趨勢）。當兩側顯示紅色和綠色條形時為喚醒階段（趨勢的形成）。兩側都顯示綠色條形時，表示進食階段（趨勢增強）。進食階段過後出現孤立的紅色條形則表明飽和階段已開始（趨勢接近結束）。","The Ichimoku Cloud, also known as Ichimoku Kinko Hyo, is a versatile indicator that defines support and resistance, identifies trend direction, gauges momentum and provides trading signals. Ichimoku Kinko Hyo translates into “one look equilibrium chart”.":"一目均衡表指標（又稱為雲圖指標）是用於定義支撐和阻力，確定趨勢方向，衡量動量並提供交易信號的多功能指標。 Ichimoku Kinko Hyo 可翻譯為一目均衡表。","The Moving Average (MA) helps to identify the overall market trend by filtering out short-term price fluctuations. Using historical data, it calculates the average price over a specific period and plots a line on the chart. If the MA line moves upwards, it’s an indicator of an uptrend, a downtrend if it moves downwards. A buy signal occurs when the price moves above the MA line.":"移動平均線（MA）通過過濾短期價格波動來幫助識別整體市場趨勢。它使用歷史數據計算特定時期的平均價格，並在圖表上繪製走勢線。如果MA線向上移動，則表示上漲趨勢。如果向下移動，則表示下跌趨勢。當價格高於MA線時，出現買入信號。","The Moving Average Envelope (MAE) helps to identify strong price movement that indicates the start of a trend. The MAE creates a moving average line as well as 2 bands around it. In theory, when the market price touches the upper or lower bands, a trend reversal will occur, indicating a buy signal.":"移動平均包絡線（MAE）幫助識別指示趨勢開始的強勁價格走勢。MAE 在其周圍創建一條移動平均線以及2條帶。從理論上講，當市場價格觸及上限或下限時，趨勢將發生反轉，表明買入信號。","The parabolic SAR is calculated almost independently for each trend in the price. When the price is in an uptrend, the SAR emerges below the price and converges upwards towards it. Similarly, on a downtrend, the SAR emerges above the price and converges downwards. At each step within a trend, the SAR is calculated one period in advance.":"拋物線轉向指標 (SAR) 的計算對價格每一趨勢都幾乎毫無關聯。當價格呈上升趨勢時，SAR在價格下冒出並朝向它往上合攏。同樣的，在下降趨勢中，SAR在價格上冒出並朝下合併。SAR在趨勢中每一步驟都提前一周期計算。","The Price Rate-of-Change (ROC) indicator displays the difference between the current price and the price x-time periods ago. The difference can be displayed in either points or as a percentage.":"價格變動率（ROC）指標顯示目前價格與x週期以前的價格差額。此差額可以點數或百分比顯示。","The Rainbow Moving Average (RMA) displays several moving average lines simultaneously. When the lines intersect, it’s an indicator of price reversal and the angle of the lines are helpful to predict the trend strength. The steeper the curve, the stronger the trend. When the price crosses the moving average lines from below, it signals an upward trend. When the price crosses the moving average lines from above, it signals a downward trend. The RMA is easier to use compared to using several different moving average indicators at once.":"彩虹移動平均線（RMA）同時顯示多條移動平均線。當各線相交時，它是價格反轉的指標，並且各線的角度有助於預測趨勢強度。曲線越陡，趨勢越強。當價格從下方穿過移動平均線時，表示上漲趨勢。當價格從上方越過移動平均線時，表明下跌趨勢。與同時使用多個不同的移動平均指標相比，RMA 更易於使用。","The Relative Strength Index (RSI) was published by J. Welles Wilder. The current price is normalized as a percentage between 0 and 100. The name of this oscillator is misleading because it does not compare the instrument relative to another instrument or set of instruments, but rather represents the current price relative to other recent pieces within the selected lookback window length.":"相對強弱指標（RSI）由J. Welles Wilder發布。目前價格被標準化為0至100之間的百分比。此指標的名稱具有誤導性，因為它並不對工具與另一工具或工具組作比較，而是在選定的回看窗口大小內顯示相對於其他近期價格的目前價格。","The Stochastic Momentum Index (SMI) helps to identify overbought or oversold conditions in the market and to predict bearish or bullish trends. It calculates the distance between the current closing price and the median of the high/low range, and displays 2 lines on the chart: the first (known as %K) represents the price movement while the second (known as %D) is a moving average of the first line. If the closing price is higher than the median of the high/low range, the SMI returns a positive value. If the closing price is lower than the average price, a negative value is returned. Values above 40 indicate a bullish trend while values below -40 indicate a bearish trend.":"隨機動量指數（SMI）幫助確定市場中的超買或超賣情況，並預測看跌或看漲趨勢。它計算當前收盤價與高/低範圍的中位數之間的距離，並在圖表上顯示2條線：第一條（稱為％K）代表價格走勢，第二條（稱為％D）代表第一條線的移動平均值。如果收盤價高於高/低範圍的中位數，則 SMI 返回正值。如果收盤價低於平均價格，則返回負值。高於40的值表示看漲趨勢，低於-40的值表示看跌趨勢。","Themes":"主題","There are no favorites yet.":"還沒有偏好。","tick":"跳動點","Tick interval only available for \\\\\\"Area\\\\\\" Chart type.":"跳動點間隔僅適用於 \\\\\\"面積\\\\\\"圖表類型。","Time interval":"時間間隔","Trend":"","Trend [num]":"趨勢 [num]","Try checking your spelling or use a different term":"嘗試檢查拼寫或使用其他字詞","Underlying Assets":"標的資產","Up to 2 active indicators allowed.":"","Up to 5 active indicators allowed.":"可同時使用多達5個活動指示器。","Vertical [num]":"垂直 [num]","Volatility":"","Would you like to overwrite it?":"是否要覆蓋它？","You have no active drawings yet.":"還沒有任何激活圖形。","You have no active indicators yet.":"還沒有任何激活指標。","You have no saved templates yet.":"您尚未儲存任何範本。","Zig Zag helps to identify trend reversals and filters out relatively small price movements by determining the support and resistance levels of the market. It accepts a percentage of deviation as the input and displays a line if the price change is larger than the percentage of deviation. Zig Zag ignores any sideways movement and is useful to filter out “market noise”.":"之字形指標通過確定市場的支持位和阻力位，幫助識別趨勢反轉並過濾相對較小的價格波動。它接受特定的偏差百分比作為輸入，如果價格變化大於該偏差百分比，則顯示一條線。之字形指標忽略任何橫向波動，對於濾除「市場噪音」很有用。","Zoom in":"放大","Zoom out":"縮小"}')}}]);

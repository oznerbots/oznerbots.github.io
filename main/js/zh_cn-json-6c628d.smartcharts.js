The Alligator is as much a metaphor as it is an indicator. It consists of three lines, overlaid on a pricing chart, that represent the jaw, the teeth and the lips of the beast, and was created to help the trader confirm the presence of a trend and its direction. The Alligator indicator can also help traders designate impulse and corrective wave formations, but the tool works best when combined with a momentum indicator.":"比尔·威廉姆斯（Bill Williams）于1995年推出了鳄鱼指标。鳄鱼指标既是隐喻，也是指标。它由覆盖在价格图表上的三行线组成，分别代表鳄鱼的下巴、牙齿和嘴唇。此指标的目的是为了帮助交易者确认趋势的存在及其走向。鳄鱼指标还可以帮助交易者指定脉冲和修正波的形成，但该工具与动量指标结合使用时效果最佳。","Bollinger Bands can be used to measure the highness or lowness of the price relative to previous trades.":"布林带可用于测量与之前交易相对的价格变化高低点。","Box Size":"箱尺寸","Cancel":"取消","Candle":"蜡烛线","Channel [num]":"通道 [num]","Chart data is not available for this symbol.":"此符号不可用于图表数据。","Chart types":"图表类型","Charts":"图表","Clear all":"全部清除","CLOSED":"已关闭","Color":"颜色","Continuous":"连续线","Continuous [num]":"连续 [num]","CSV":"CSV","Dark":"深色","day":"天","days":"天","Developed by Larry Williams, Williams %R is a momentum indicator that is the inverse of the Fast Stochastic Oscillator.

Welles Wilder 于1978年开发的一种显示金融工具各项价格走势强弱的指标。ADX 幅度介于0和100之间。一般来说，ADX低于20表示低弱走势，数值高于40表示强大走势。","The Awesome Oscillator is an indicator used to measure market momentum. AO calculates the difference of a 34 Period and 5 Period Simple Moving Averages. The Simple Moving Averages that are used are not calculated using closing price but rather each bar\'s midpoints. AO is generally used to affirm trends or to anticipate possible reversals.":"动量震荡指标是用于衡量市场动量的指标。 AO 计算34个周期和5个周期的简单移动平均的差。使用的简单移动平均不是使用收盘价计算的，而是每个柱的中点价格。AO通常被用来确认趋势或预期可能的逆转。","The Commodity Channel Index (CCI) is a versatile indicator that can be used to identify a new trend or warn of extreme conditions.":"顺势指标 (CCI) 是个通用指标，可用于辨识新趋势或预先对恶劣环境提出警告。","The Detrended Price Oscillator (DPO) helps to identify price cycles without the influence of short- and long-term trends. The DPO compares a simple moving average to a historical pricenear the middle of a specified period. It also shows the peaks and drops over that particular period, making it easier to predict buy points.":"去趋势价格振荡指标（DPO）帮助确定价格周期，不受短期和长期趋势影响。DPO 将简单移动平均线与指定时期中间附近的历史价格相比较。它还显示了特定时期内的高峰和低谷，从而更容易预测购买点。","The Donchian Channel is an indicator used in market trading developed by Richard Donchian. It is formed by taking the highest high and the lowest low of the last n periods. The area between the high and the low is the channel for the period chosen.":"唐奇安通道是里查德·唐奇安开发、用于市场交易的指标。以最近n周期内的最高价与最低价形成。高低价位中间区域是所选周期的通道。","The Gator Oscillator helps to detect trend changes in the market price. Based on the Alligator indicator, the Gator plots 2 histograms on either side of the zero line. The sleeping phase (absence of a trend) is when the bars on both sides are red. The awakening phase (formation of a trend) is when there are red and green bars on both sides. When there are green bars on both sides, it indicates the eating phase (trend strengthening). A solitary red bar appearing after the eating phase indicates the beginning of the sated phase (trend approaching its end).":"鳄鱼振荡指标帮助检测市场价格的趋势变化。鳄鱼根据短吻鳄指标在零线的任一侧绘制2个直方图。当两侧的条形为红色时为睡眠阶段（不存在趋势）。当两侧显示红色和绿色条形时为唤醒阶段（趋势的形成）。两侧都显示绿色条形时，表示进食阶段（趋势增强）。进食阶段过后出现孤立的红色条形则表明饱和阶段已开始（趋势接近结束）。","The Ichimoku Cloud, also known as Ichimoku Kinko Hyo, is a versatile indicator that defines support and resistance, identifies trend direction, gauges momentum and provides trading signals. Ichimoku Kinko Hyo translates into “one look equilibrium chart”.":"一目均衡表指标（又称为云图指标）是用于定义支撑和阻力，确定趋势方向，衡量动量并提供交易信号的多功能指标。Ichimoku Kinko Hyo 可翻译为一目均衡表。","The Moving Average (MA) helps to identify the overall market trend by filtering out short-term price fluctuations. Using historical data, it calculates the average price over a specific period and plots a line on the chart. If the MA line moves upwards, it’s an indicator of an uptrend, a downtrend if it moves downwards. A buy signal occurs when the price moves above the MA line.":"移动平均线（MA）通过过滤短期价格波动来帮助识别整体市场趋势。它使用历史数据计算特定时期的平均价格，并在图表上绘制走势线。如果MA线向上移动，则表示上涨趋势。如果向下移动，则表示下跌趋势。当价格高于MA线时，出现买入信号。","The Moving Average Envelope (MAE) helps to identify strong price movement that indicates the start of a trend. The MAE creates a moving average line as well as 2 bands around it. In theory, when the market price touches the upper or lower bands, a trend reversal will occur, indicating a buy signal.":"移动平均包络线（MAE）帮助识别指示趋势开始的强劲价格走势。MAE 在其周围创建一条移动平均线以及2条带。从理论上讲，当市场价格触及上限或下限时，趋势将发生反转，表明买入信号。","The parabolic SAR is calculated almost independently for each trend in the price. When the price is in an uptrend, the SAR emerges below the price and converges upwards towards it. Similarly, on a downtrend, the SAR emerges above the price and converges downwards. At each step within a trend, the SAR is calculated one period in advance.":"抛物线 SAR 几乎是针对每种价格趋势独立计算的。当价格处于上涨趋势时，SAR 将出现在价格之下，然后向上收并。同样，在下跌趋势中，SAR 出现在价格之上并向下收并。趋势里的每一步中，SAR 都会提前一个周期计算。","The Price Rate-of-Change (ROC) indicator displays the difference between the current price and the price x-time periods ago. The difference can be displayed in either points or as a percentage.":"价格变动率 (ROC) 指标显示当前价格与x周期以前的价格差额。此差额可以点数或百分比显示。","The Rainbow Moving Average (RMA) displays several moving average lines simultaneously. When the lines intersect, it’s an indicator of price reversal and the angle of the lines are helpful to predict the trend strength. The steeper the curve, the stronger the trend. When the price crosses the moving average lines from below, it signals an upward trend. When the price crosses the moving average lines from above, it signals a downward trend. The RMA is easier to use compared to using several different moving average indicators at once.":"彩虹移动平均线（RMA）同时显示多条移动平均线。当各线相交时，它是价格反转的指标，并且各线的角度有助于预测趋势强度。曲线越陡，趋势越强。当价格从下方穿过移动平均线时，表示上涨趋势。当价格从上方越过移动平均线时，表明下跌趋势。 与同时使用多个不同的移动平均指标相比，RMA 更易于使用。","The Relative Strength Index (RSI) was published by J. Welles Wilder. The current price is normalized as a percentage between 0 and 100. The name of this oscillator is misleading because it does not compare the instrument relative to another instrument or set of instruments, but rather represents the current price relative to other recent pieces within the selected lookback window length.":"相对强度指标（RSI）由J. Welles Wilder发布。当前价格被归一化为0到100之间的百分比。此振荡指标的名称具有误导性，因为它不是将指定工具与另一工具或一组工具进行比较，而是在选定回溯窗口长度范围内代表相对于其他最近价格的当前价格。","The Stochastic Momentum Index (SMI) helps to identify overbought or oversold conditions in the market and to predict bearish or bullish trends. It calculates the distance between the current closing price and the median of the high/low range, and displays 2 lines on the chart: the first (known as %K) represents the price movement while the second (known as %D) is a moving average of the first line. If the closing price is higher than the median of the high/low range, the SMI returns a positive value. If the closing price is lower than the average price, a negative value is returned. Values above 40 indicate a bullish trend while values below -40 indicate a bearish trend.":"随机动量指数（SMI）帮助确定市场中的超买或超卖情况，并预测看跌或看涨趋势。它计算当前收盘价与高/低范围的中位数之间的距离，并在图表上显示2条线：第一条（称为％K）代表价格走势，第二条（称为％D）代表第一条线的移动平均值。如果收盘价高于高/低范围的中位数，则 SMI 返回正值。如果收盘价低于平均价格，则返回负值。高于40的值表示看涨趋势，低于-40的值表示看跌趋势。","Themes":"主题","There are no favorites yet.":"还没有收藏夹。","tick":"跳动点","Tick interval only available for \\\\\\"Area\\\\\\" Chart type.":"跳动点间隔仅适用于 \\\\\\"面积\\\\\\"图表类型。","Time interval":"时间间隔","Trend":"","Trend [num]":"趋势 [num]","Try checking your spelling or use a different term":"尝试检查拼写或使用其他术语","Underlying Assets":"标的资产","Up to 2 active indicators allowed.":"","Up to 5 active indicators allowed.":"可同时使用多达5个活动指示器。","Vertical [num]":"垂直 [num]","Volatility":"","Would you like to overwrite it?":"是否要覆盖它？","You have no active drawings yet.":"还没有任何激活图形。","You have no active indicators yet.":"还没有任何激活指标。","You have no saved templates yet.":"您尚未保存任何模板。","Zig Zag helps to identify trend reversals and filters out relatively small price movements by determining the support and resistance levels of the market.
